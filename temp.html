        1998,\nit felt like the center of the world. It was supposed to be the\nnext big thing. It was supposed to be
        what Google turned out to\nbe.<br><br>What went wrong? The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long
        time,\npractically to the beginning of the company. They were already\nvery visible when I got there in 1998.
        Yahoo had two problems\nGoogle didn\'t: easy money, and ambivalence about being a
        technology\ncompany.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting
        for\ndifferent reasons. He thought we were meeting so he could check\nus out in person before buying us. I
        thought we were meeting so we\ncould show him our new technology, Revenue Loop. It was a way of\nsorting
        shopping search results. Merchants bid a percentage of\nsales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by
        the bid but\nby the bid times the average amount a user would buy. It was\nlike the algorithm Google uses now to
        sort ads, but this was in the\nspring of 1998, before Google was founded.<br><br>Revenue Loop was the optimal
        sort for shopping search, in the sense\nthat it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from\neach
        link. But it wasn\'t just optimal in that sense. Ranking\nsearch results by user behavior also makes search
        better. Users\ntrain the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere\ntextual similarity, and as
        users buy more stuff the search results\nget better and better.<br><br>Jerry didn\'t seem to care. I was
        confused. I was showing him\ntechnology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,\nand he didn\'t
        care? I couldn\'t tell whether I was explaining it\nbadly, or he was just very poker faced.<br><br>I didn\'t
        realize the answer till later, after I went to work at\nYahoo. It was neither of my guesses. The reason Yahoo
        didn\'t care\nabout a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that\nadvertisers were already
        overpaying for it. If Yahoo merely extracted\nthe actual value, they\'d have made less.<br><br>Hard as it is to
        believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.\nAdvertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for
        banner ads.\nSo Yahoo\'s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.\nLed by a large and
        terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,\nYahoo\'s sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and
        come back\nwith million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.<br><br>The prices seemed cheap compared to
        print, which was what advertisers,\nfor lack of any other reference, compared them to. But they were\nexpensive
        compared to what they were worth. So these big, dumb\ncompanies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.
        But\nthere was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.<br><br>By 1998, Yahoo was the
        beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.\nInvestors were excited about the Internet. One reason they
        were\nexcited was Yahoo\'s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet\nstartups. The startups then used
        the money to buy ads on Yahoo to\nget traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and\nfurther
        convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.\nWhen I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I
        jumped up\nlike Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of "Eureka!" I was\nshouting "Sell!"<br><br>Both the
        Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing\nbrand advertising. They didn\'t care about
        targeting. They just\nwanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the thing\nto get at Yahoo. It
        didn\'t matter what type.\n<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n">
                <font color="#999999">1</font>
            </a>]</font><br><br>It wasn\'t just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it. This\nwas why they were
        trying to get people to start calling them "portals"\ninstead of "search engines." Despite the actual meaning of
        the word\nportal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find\nwhat they wanted on the site itself,
        instead of just passing through\non their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.<br><br>I
        remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo\nshould buy Google, because I and most of the
        other programmers in\nthe company were using it instead of Yahoo for search. He told me\nthat it wasn\'t worth
        worrying about. Search was only 6% of our\ntraffic, and we were growing at 10% a month. It wasn\'t worth
        doing\nbetter.<br><br>I didn\'t say "But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!"\nI said "Oh, ok."
        Because I didn\'t realize either how much search\ntraffic was worth. I\'m not sure even Larry and Sergey did
        then.\nIf they had, Google presumably wouldn\'t have expended any effort\non enterprise search.<br><br>If
        circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might\nhave realized sooner how important search was.
        But they had the\nmost opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.\nAs long as customers
        were writing big checks for banner ads, it was\nhard to take search seriously. Google didn\'t have that to
        distract\nthem.<br><br><b>Hackers</b><br><br>But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to
        change\ndirections. They\'d been thrown off balance from the start by their\nambivalence about being a
        technology company.<br><br>One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there\nwas the way they
        insisted on calling themselves a "media company."\nIf you walked around their offices, it seemed like a
        software\ncompany. The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product\nmanagers thinking about feature
        lists and ship dates, support people\n(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart\ntheir
        browsers, and so on, just like a software company. So why\ndid they call themselves a media company?<br><br>One
        reason was the way they made money: by selling ads. In 1995\nit was hard to imagine a technology company making
        money that way.\nTechnology companies made money by selling their software to users.\nMedia companies sold ads.
        So they must be a media company.<br><br>Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft. If anyone at
        Yahoo\nconsidered the idea that they should be a technology company, the\nnext thought would have been that
        Microsoft would crush them.<br><br>It\'s hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear\nMicrosoft
        still inspired in 1995. Imagine a company with several\ntimes the power Google has now, but way meaner. It was
        perfectly\nreasonable to be afraid of them. Yahoo watched them crush the first\nhot Internet company, Netscape.
        It was reasonable to worry that\nif they tried to be the next Netscape, they\'d suffer the same fate.\nHow were
        they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft\'s\nlast victim?<br><br>It would have been a clever
        move to pretend to be a media company\nto throw Microsoft off their scent. But unfortunately Yahoo
        actually\ntried to be one, sort of. Project managers at Yahoo were called\n"producers," for example, and the
        different parts of the company\nwere called "properties." But what Yahoo really needed to be was a\ntechnology
        company, and by trying to be something else, they ended\nup being something that was neither here nor there.
        That\'s why\nYahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.<br><br>The worst consequence of trying
        to be a media company was that they\ndidn\'t take programming seriously enough. Microsoft (back in the\nday),
        Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.\nBut Yahoo treated programming as a commodity. At
        Yahoo, user-facing software\nwas controlled by product managers and designers. The job of\nprogrammers was just
        to take the work of the product managers and\ndesigners the final step, by translating it into code.<br><br>One
        obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,\nthey often weren\'t very good. But that
        wasn\'t the worst problem.\nThe worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.<br><br>Microsoft (back in the
        day), Google, and Facebook have all been\nobsessed with hiring the best programmers. Yahoo wasn\'t.
        They\npreferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn\'t have the\nkind of single-minded, almost
        obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring\nthe smartest people that the big winners have had. And when you\nconsider
        how much competition there was for programmers when they\nwere hiring, during the Bubble, it\'s not surprising
        that the quality\nof their programmers was uneven.<br><br>In technology, once you have bad programmers, you\'re
        doomed. I\ncan\'t think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical\nmediocrity and recovered. Good
        programmers want to work with other\ngood programmers. So once the quality of programmers at your
        company\nstarts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no\nrecovery.\n<font color="#999999">[<a
                href="#f2n">
                <font color="#999999">2</font>
            </a>]</font><br><br>At Yahoo this death spiral started early. If there was ever a time when\nYahoo was a
        Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I\ngot there in 1998.<br><br>The company felt prematurely
        old. Most technology companies\neventually get taken over by suits and middle managers. At Yahoo\nit felt as if
        they\'d deliberately accelerated this process. They\ndidn\'t want to be a bunch of hackers. They wanted to be
        suits. A\nmedia company should be run by suits.<br><br>The first time I visited Google, they had about 500
        people, the\nsame number Yahoo had when I went to work there. But boy did things\nseem different. It was still
        very much a hacker-centric culture.\nI remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the\nproblem
        of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked\n"what should we do?" Programmers at Yahoo wouldn\'t
        have asked that.\nTheirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product\nmanagers spec\'d. I remember
        coming away from Google thinking "Wow,\nit\'s still a startup."<br><br>There\'s not much we can learn from
        Yahoo\'s first fatal flaw. It\'s\nprobably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by\ndepending
        on a bogus source of revenue. But startups can learn an\nimportant lesson from the second one. In the software
        business,\nyou can\'t afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.<br><br>Probably the most impressive
        commitment I\'ve heard to having a\nhacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at\nStartup
        School in 2007. He said that in the early days Facebook\nmade a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that
        would not\nordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.<br><br>So which companies need to have a
        hacker-centric culture? Which\ncompanies are "in the software business" in this respect? As Yahoo\ndiscovered,
        the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people\nrealize. The answer is: any company that needs to have
        good software.<br><br>Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn\'t\nhave a hacker-centric
        culture, as long as there were others that\ndid? I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,\nor
        if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it\nwere hacker-centric. Otherwise you can\'t attract
        good programmers\nto work in a suit-centric culture. And without good programmers\nyou won\'t get good software,
        no matter how many people you put on\na task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure
        "quality."<br><br><a href="gba.html">Hacker culture</a> \noften seems kind of irresponsible. That\'s why
        people\nproposing to destroy it use phrases like "adult supervision." That\nwas the phrase they used at Yahoo.
        But there are worse things than\nseeming irresponsible. Losing, for
        example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n">
            <font color="#000000">1</font>
        </a>]\nThe closest we got to targeting when I was there was when we\ncreated pets.yahoo.com in order to provoke
        a bidding war between 3\npet supply startups for the spot as top sponsor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">
            <font color="#000000">2</font>
        </a>]\nIn theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good\nprogrammers instead of hiring them. You can get
        programmers\nwho would never have come to you as employees by buying their \nstartups. But so far the only
        companies smart enough\nto do this are companies smart enough not to need to.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor
