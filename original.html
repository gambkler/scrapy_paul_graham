                                    </tr>\n</table>\n<p>\nAugust 2010<br><br>When I went to work for Yahoo after they
                                    bought our startup in 1998,\nit felt like the center of the world. It was supposed
                                    to be the\nnext big thing. It was supposed to be what Google turned out
                                    to\nbe.<br><br>What went wrong? The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long
                                    time,\npractically to the beginning of the company. They were already\nvery visible
                                    when I got there in 1998. Yahoo had two problems\nGoogle didn\'t: easy money, and
                                    ambivalence about being a technology\ncompany.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>The first
                                    time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for\ndifferent reasons. He thought
                                    we were meeting so he could check\nus out in person before buying us. I thought we
                                    were meeting so we\ncould show him our new technology, Revenue Loop. It was a way
                                    of\nsorting shopping search results. Merchants bid a percentage of\nsales for
                                    traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but\nby the bid times the
                                    average amount a user would buy. It was\nlike the algorithm Google uses now to sort
                                    ads, but this was in the\nspring of 1998, before Google was founded.<br><br>Revenue
                                    Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense\nthat it sorted in order
                                    of how much money Yahoo would make from\neach link. But it wasn\'t just optimal in
                                    that sense. Ranking\nsearch results by user behavior also makes search better.
                                    Users\ntrain the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere\ntextual
                                    similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results\nget better and
                                    better.<br><br>Jerry didn\'t seem to care. I was confused. I was showing
                                    him\ntechnology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,\nand he
                                    didn\'t care? I couldn\'t tell whether I was explaining it\nbadly, or he was just
                                    very poker faced.<br><br>I didn\'t realize the answer till later, after I went to
                                    work at\nYahoo. It was neither of my guesses. The reason Yahoo didn\'t care\nabout a
                                    technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that\nadvertisers were
                                    already overpaying for it. If Yahoo merely extracted\nthe actual value, they\'d have
                                    made less.<br><br>Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner
                                    ads.\nAdvertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.\nSo
                                    Yahoo\'s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.\nLed by a large
                                    and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,\nYahoo\'s sales guys would fly
                                    out to Procter & Gamble and come back\nwith million dollar orders for banner ad
                                    impressions.<br><br>The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what
                                    advertisers,\nfor lack of any other reference, compared them to. But they
                                    were\nexpensive compared to what they were worth. So these big, dumb\ncompanies were
                                    a dangerous source of revenue to depend on. But\nthere was another source even more
                                    dangerous: other Internet startups.<br><br>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a
                                    de facto Ponzi scheme.\nInvestors were excited about the Internet. One reason they
                                    were\nexcited was Yahoo\'s revenue growth. So they invested in new
                                    Internet\nstartups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to\nget
                                    traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and\nfurther convinced
                                    investors the Internet was worth investing in.\nWhen I realized this one day,
                                    sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up\nlike Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead
                                    of "Eureka!" I was\nshouting "Sell!"<br><br>Both the Internet startups and the
                                    Procter & Gambles were doing\nbrand advertising. They didn\'t care about targeting.
                                    They just\nwanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the thing\nto
                                    get at Yahoo. It didn\'t matter what type.\n<font color=#999999>[<a href="#f1n">
                                            <font color=#999999>1</font>
                                        </a>]</font><br><br>It wasn\'t just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it.
                                    This\nwas why they were trying to get people to start calling them
                                    "portals"\ninstead of "search engines." Despite the actual meaning of the
                                    word\nportal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find\nwhat they
                                    wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through\non their way to other
                                    destinations, as they did at a search engine.<br><br>I remember telling David Filo
                                    in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo\nshould buy Google, because I and most of the
                                    other programmers in\nthe company were using it instead of Yahoo for search. He told
                                    me\nthat it wasn\'t worth worrying about. Search was only 6% of our\ntraffic, and we
                                    were growing at 10% a month. It wasn\'t worth doing\nbetter.<br><br>I didn\'t say
                                    "But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!"\nI said "Oh, ok." Because I
                                    didn\'t realize either how much search\ntraffic was worth. I\'m not sure even Larry
                                    and Sergey did then.\nIf they had, Google presumably wouldn\'t have expended any
                                    effort\non enterprise search.<br><br>If circumstances had been different, the people
                                    running Yahoo might\nhave realized sooner how important search was. But they had
                                    the\nmost opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.\nAs long
                                    as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was\nhard to take search
                                    seriously. Google didn\'t have that to
                                    distract\nthem.<br><br><b>Hackers</b><br><br>But Yahoo also had another problem that
                                    made it hard to change\ndirections. They\'d been thrown off balance from the start
                                    by their\nambivalence about being a technology company.<br><br>One of the weirdest
                                    things about Yahoo when I went to work there\nwas the way they insisted on calling
                                    themselves a "media company."\nIf you walked around their offices, it seemed like a
                                    software\ncompany. The cubicles were full of programmers writing code,
                                    product\nmanagers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people\n(yes,
                                    there were actually support people) telling users to restart\ntheir browsers, and so
                                    on, just like a software company. So why\ndid they call themselves a media
                                    company?<br><br>One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads. In 1995\nit
                                    was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.\nTechnology
                                    companies made money by selling their software to users.\nMedia companies sold ads.
                                    So they must be a media company.<br><br>Another big factor was the fear of
                                    Microsoft. If anyone at Yahoo\nconsidered the idea that they should be a technology
                                    company, the\nnext thought would have been that Microsoft would crush
                                    them.<br><br>It\'s hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the
                                    fear\nMicrosoft still inspired in 1995. Imagine a company with several\ntimes the
                                    power Google has now, but way meaner. It was perfectly\nreasonable to be afraid of
                                    them. Yahoo watched them crush the first\nhot Internet company, Netscape. It was
                                    reasonable to worry that\nif they tried to be the next Netscape, they\'d suffer the
                                    same fate.\nHow were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be
                                    Microsoft\'s\nlast victim?<br><br>It would have been a clever move to pretend to be
                                    a media company\nto throw Microsoft off their scent. But unfortunately Yahoo
                                    actually\ntried to be one, sort of. Project managers at Yahoo were
                                    called\n"producers," for example, and the different parts of the company\nwere
                                    called "properties." But what Yahoo really needed to be was a\ntechnology company,
                                    and by trying to be something else, they ended\nup being something that was neither
                                    here nor there. That\'s why\nYahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined
                                    identity.<br><br>The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that
                                    they\ndidn\'t take programming seriously enough. Microsoft (back in the\nday),
                                    Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.\nBut Yahoo treated
                                    programming as a commodity. At Yahoo, user-facing software\nwas controlled by
                                    product managers and designers. The job of\nprogrammers was just to take the work of
                                    the product managers and\ndesigners the final step, by translating it into
                                    code.<br><br>One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built
                                    things,\nthey often weren\'t very good. But that wasn\'t the worst problem.\nThe
                                    worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.<br><br>Microsoft (back in the
                                    day), Google, and Facebook have all been\nobsessed with hiring the best programmers.
                                    Yahoo wasn\'t. They\npreferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn\'t have
                                    the\nkind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring\nthe smartest
                                    people that the big winners have had. And when you\nconsider how much competition
                                    there was for programmers when they\nwere hiring, during the Bubble, it\'s not
                                    surprising that the quality\nof their programmers was uneven.<br><br>In technology,
                                    once you have bad programmers, you\'re doomed. I\ncan\'t think of an instance where
                                    a company has sunk into technical\nmediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want
                                    to work with other\ngood programmers. So once the quality of programmers at your
                                    company\nstarts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is
                                    no\nrecovery.\n<font color=#999999>[<a href="#f2n">

                                        </a>]</font><br><br>At Yahoo this death spiral started early. If there was ever
                                    a time when\nYahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I\ngot
                                    there in 1998.<br><br>The company felt prematurely old. Most technology
                                    companies\neventually get taken over by suits and middle managers. At Yahoo\nit felt
                                    as if they\'d deliberately accelerated this process. They\ndidn\'t want to be a
                                    bunch of hackers. They wanted to be suits. A\nmedia company should be run by
                                    suits.<br><br>The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the\nsame
                                    number Yahoo had when I went to work there. But boy did things\nseem different. It
                                    was still very much a hacker-centric culture.\nI remember talking to some
                                    programmers in the cafeteria about the\nproblem of gaming search results (now known
                                    as SEO), and they asked\n"what should we do?" Programmers at Yahoo wouldn\'t have
                                    asked that.\nTheirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what
                                    product\nmanagers spec\'d. I remember coming away from Google thinking "Wow,\nit\'s
                                    still a startup."<br><br>There\'s not much we can learn from Yahoo\'s first fatal
                                    flaw. It\'s\nprobably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged
                                    by\ndepending on a bogus source of revenue. But startups can learn an\nimportant
                                    lesson from the second one. In the software business,\nyou can\'t afford not to have
                                    a hacker-centric culture.<br><br>Probably the most impressive commitment I\'ve heard
                                    to having a\nhacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke
                                    at\nStartup School in 2007. He said that in the early days Facebook\nmade a point of
                                    hiring programmers even for jobs that would not\nordinarily consist of programming,
                                    like HR and marketing.<br><br>So which companies need to have a hacker-centric
                                    culture? Which\ncompanies are "in the software business" in this respect? As
                                    Yahoo\ndiscovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most
                                    people\nrealize. The answer is: any company that needs to have good
                                    software.<br><br>Why would great programmers want to work for a company that
                                    didn\'t\nhave a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that\ndid? I
                                    can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,\nor if the domain was
                                    interesting and none of the companies in it\nwere hacker-centric. Otherwise you
                                    can\'t attract good programmers\nto work in a suit-centric culture. And without good
                                    programmers\nyou won\'t get good software, no matter how many people you put on\na
                                    task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure "quality."<br><br><a
                                        href="gba.html">Hacker culture</a> \noften seems kind of irresponsible. That\'s
                                    why people\nproposing to destroy it use phrases like "adult supervision." That\nwas
                                    the phrase they used at Yahoo. But there are worse things than\nseeming
                                    irresponsible. Losing, for example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a

                                    </a>]\nIn theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good\nprogrammers instead
                                    of hiring them. You can get programmers\nwho would never have come to you as
                                    employees by buying their \nstartups. But so far the only companies smart enough\nto
                                    do this are companies smart enough not to need to.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor
